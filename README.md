# db_downhole_chart
create charts showing downhole geology+grades of mining drillholes

## Description
Downhole charts are a common type of visualization for drillhole data. Those charts allow for a quick glipse of the information contained on the intervals. Many proprietary softwares already have bult-in tools for generating those charts, but open source tools are not available.
## how to use
The required files is the assay database with intervals and a SCD file with palete and legend. This SCD file is in a proprietary format, but is a simple ASCII file which may be adapted. The script may be easily modified to read palete and legends for other sources.
